# Counter-App
This is a basic react app which i built to get familiar with setting up react project and getting to use react Hooks like useState for storing and updating values dynamically. Counter App displays certain buttons on UI which when clicked increments and decrements the value of variable whose default value would be set to 0 on project startup.
